## Server vs Client sides

- CSR: 
	- What is it:
		- Server gives `<div id="root"></div>` and JS to client. Client renders it all
	- Disadvantages:
		- Bad SEO
		- Browser must render all the JS on browser first before website us usable
- SSR & Hydration: 
	- What is it:
		- Rendered on server then send to client. Hydration takes over and makes interactive.
	- Types:
		- SSR: Rendered on server at request time. Good for personalized contents, eg: logged in users
		- SSG: Rendered on server at deploy/build time. Good for largely static contents, eg blogs
			- ISR: When data changes, individual pages gets rebuild, instead of the whole site.
		- More info on various rendering patterns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkx5ydvtpCA
	- Disadvantages:
		- Server must get all the needed data before it renders the page
		- All JavaScript must download from the server before the client can be hydrated with it.
		- All hydration has to complete on the client before anything can be interacted with.
- SSR & Suspense: 
	- What is it:
		- The `<Suspense component>`, allowing:
			- HTML streaming: Server don't need all the data before it renders the page
			- Code splitting: JavaScript are streamed to the browser piece-meal
			- Selective hydration: Hydration in piece-meal, according to priority or need
	- Disadvantages:
		- If there a lot of JS, then browser still need to download them all eventually. There has to be a better way, ie: some of the JS work can be done on the server
		- Things that dont need hydration gets hydrated too
- React Server Components: 
	- What is it:
		- React invented Server components in version ~18/19, Next uses it since version 13. Next introduced App router in version 13, it's built around the RSC architecture. In App Router projects, a component is server side by default, unless have `"use client"` specified at the top of the file.
		- Server and Client components are seperated. 
		- Server components only runs on the server, it never gets downloaded to the browser, hence reducing the load on the browser.
		- Client components handles interactivity
	- Advantages:
		- Less JS need to be download to browser
		- Data fetching in server components, on server side, which is closer to data source, hence faster.
		- Sensitive info kept on server side

## Next 13 changes

Next 13 added the new **App Router** on top of its pre existing **Page Router**

### SSR, SSG & ISR

**In App Router**

```
fetch (URL), {
  cache: "force-cache", // SSG
  cache: "no-store", // SSR
  next: {revalidate: 1} // ISR
})
```

`fetch` vs Next's patched `fetch`:  
- Original `fetch`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#parameters
- Next's `fetch`: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch 
	- Note: Next's `fetch` have an extra options field called `next`, in which you can specify ISR revalidation time

**In Page Router**

- SSR: `getServerSideProps`
- SSG: `getStaticProps` & `getStaticPaths`
- ISR:
```
function getStaticProps() {
  // ...
  return {
    props: { THE RESULT },
    revalidate: 1
  }
}
```
